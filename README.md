# Kaleidoscope
This is a C++ application developed as a final project for a university course on computer graphics. The program simulates the behavior of a kaleidoscope, allowing users to load an image and apply various transformations to create kaleidoscopic effects. The application leverages the wxWidgets library for the GUI and wxFormBuilder for designing the interface.

## Features
- Kaleidoscope Simulation: Simulate the effects of a kaleidoscope on a loaded image.
- Image Loading: Load an image to be transformed by the kaleidoscope simulation.
- Translation and Rotation: Apply vertical and horizontal translation to the image, and rotate the kaleidoscope axes by any angle.
- Adjustable Axes: Change the number of kaleidoscope axes to vary the pattern.
- Image Saving: Save the transformed image to a file.
- Image Series Generation: Generate a series of images with smoothly changing translation values and axis rotation angles.

## Usage
- Launch the application.
- Load an image to be transformed using the kaleidoscope simulation.
- Adjust the vertical and horizontal translation of the image.
- Change the number of kaleidoscope axes to alter the pattern.
- Rotate the kaleidoscope axes by any desired angle.
- Save the transformed image to a file if desired.
- Generate a series of images with smoothly changing translation values and rotation angles.

## Installation
The .exe file works correctly on Windows.

## Notes
This project was developed as part of a university course on computer graphics. The simulation provides an interactive way to explore the visual effects produced by a kaleidoscope, making it both educational and entertaining.
